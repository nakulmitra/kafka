# Why was Kafka Created?

Kafka was originally developed at LinkedIn to handle large-scale event streaming and activity tracking.

## Problems Kafka Solved

- High-throughput ingestion of logs and events
- Real-time analytics
- Durable and fault-tolerant message delivery
- Replacing batch-based pipelines with real-time streaming

## Traditional Messaging Systems Lacked:

- Horizontal scalability
- Efficient storage with disk-based queues
- Built-in distributed architecture

Kafka filled these gaps, becoming the foundation of modern data pipelines.
